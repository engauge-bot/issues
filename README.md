# Engauge Issues

This repository is used to record issues for the Discord bot [Engauge](https://engau.ge).

## When to open an issue

### Bugs

If you have run into an issue and have spoken with staff in the support server's support channel
and they have confirmed it is a bug, feel free to open an issue in this repository so it can be
properly addressed.

### Suggestions/changes

If you have a suggestion that has been discussed already in the server but requires more input,
please consider opening an issue here to organize conversation more clearly.

## Contributing

This repository holds no information besides this README, so it is unlikely you will need
to contribute. That said, if you find something to change in this README, feel freet to open a PR!
